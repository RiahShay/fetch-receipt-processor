## Installation

### Prerequisites
Make sure you have Python 3.8 or later installed.

1. Clone the repository to your local machine:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-repo/project-name.git
   cd project-name
   ```

2. Set up a virtual environment (optional but recommended):

   ```bash
   python3 -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows, use `venv\Scripts\activate`
   ```

3. Install the required dependencies:

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Usage

Provide basic instructions on how to use the project. This may include examples of how to run scripts, start services, or interact with the software.

For example:

1. Run the main script:

   ```bash
   python app/main.py
   ```

2. Access the web service at:

   ```
   http://localhost:8000
   ```

## Docker

### Build the Docker Image

To build the Docker image, make sure you're in the root directory of the project (where the `Dockerfile` is located), and then run:

```bash
docker build -t receipt-processor .
```

This command will build the Docker image using the `Dockerfile` and tag it as `receipt-processor`.

### Run the Docker Container

Once the image is built, you can run the container with the following command:

```bash
docker run -d -p 8000:8000 --name receipt-processor-container receipt-processor
```

This will run the application in the background, exposing it on port `8000`. Adjust the port as necessary depending on your application's configuration.


## Testing

### Running Tests

We use `pytest` for testing. To run the tests, make sure you have the dependencies installed and run:

```bash
pytest
```

### Writing Tests

Tests are located in the `tests/` directory. Each module should have a corresponding test file in this directory.

## Contributing

2. Create a new branch (`git checkout -b feature-name`).
3. Make your changes.
4. Commit your changes (`git commit -am 'Add feature'`).
5. Push to the branch (`git push origin feature-name`).
6. Create a new Pull Request.
